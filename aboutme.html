                <p>Hello!<br>
                My name is Mike Evans. I have spent the last 12 years on the logistics/warehousing side of the furniture
                retail business. I am currently going to school for Software Engineering. My current coursework has taken
                me through HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Angular. I have also learned SQL and Python. Currently I am looking
                to get my foot in the door as a Front-End Web Developer to expand my knowledge and to gain experience on
                my way to developing applications in various programming languages.<br>
                I am looking to pivot careers in order to be able to spend more time with my family. I currently work as a
                transportation manager, which means that I am on-call 24/7. This makes it so that I am away from my family
                more than I would like to be. I am out of the house for 12 hours every day, and would like to find a career
                that provides me with the work/life balance that I am looking for. I am a dedicated employee, and I do 
                everything in my power to make sure that my company is successful.<br>
                Thank you for taking the time to read through my portfolio.</p>
